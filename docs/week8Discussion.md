# Week 8 Discussion Notes

1. Week 10 Friday Deadline for Project Proposal
2. Create a weekly meeting arrangement
3. 18 Dec 2022 Meeting, each of us has a draft of proposal
4. Machine learning to match 2 metrics, Respiratory signal and the heart ECG
5. Regression - linear, polynomial, logistics
6. System for the project
   - programming language - Python Notebook .ipynb
   - Jupyter
7. Outcome of the project is get a **model**
   - high accuracy
   - hyperparameters
8. Data exploration - learn how the data looks, meaning, visualization

### Meeting at 18 December 2022, Sunday, at 2 pm

1. Xue Ying suggest Support Vector Machine (SVM) for regression - Algorithm used
